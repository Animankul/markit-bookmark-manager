⚡ Challenges Faced while developing MarkIt

I am a MERN stack developer and have previously built multiple web and mobile applications using React.js, React Native, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, including secure authentication using JWT.

This project was my first experience using Supabase as a backend and implementing Google OAuth authentication, which was completely new to me. I faced challenges during the initial setup, authentication configuration, and realtime database integration. However, overcoming these challenges helped me understand backend-as-a-service concepts better, and it was an exciting learning experience exploring new technologies beyond the traditional MERN stack.
